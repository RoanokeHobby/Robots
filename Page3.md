Yippie! This page will contain posts related to the [CamJam EduKit 3](https://camjam.me/?page_id=1035).

Unless otherwise noted, code for the **CamJam EduKit 3** will be in Python 3. Opinions expressed here are my own and not associated with [Cambridge Raspberry Jam](http://camjam.me/) or [The Pi Hut](https://thepihut.com/). Occasionally, I'll be experimenting with [GPIO Zero](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/), created by [Ben Nuttall](https://github.com/bennuttall) of the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), [Dave Jones](https://github.com/waveform80) and other contributors. Many thanks to all of the above for their many contributions to the DIY maker community!
